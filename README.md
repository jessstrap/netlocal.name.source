### netlocal.name
The purpose of this domain is to create a private address space in the DNS system as a public resource. 
It will be analogous to the [private address ranges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network#Private_IPv4_addresses) in IPv4 and IPv6. 

<br>
The guarantee that I, the current owner of `netlocal.name`, give you, the general public, is this: 

# No subdomain of `netlocal.name`<sup id="a1">[*](#f1)</sup> will be entered into the public domain name system for as long as I have ownership of the domain `netlocal.name`.
<sup id="f1">[*](#a1) i.e. domains matching `*.netlocal.name`[^](#a1)</sup>

I plan to keep this guarantee as long as I have ownership of netlocal.name. I currently own it through May 2030.

This means that you can set and use `*.netlocal.name` domain names freely in your own private networks without any fear 
of collisions with public domain names.

Suggested names:
- `home.netlocal.name`
- `files.netlocal.name`
- `router.netlocal.name`
- `living-room-pc.netlocal.name`
- `intranet-site.netlocal.name`
- `build-server.netlocal.name`
- `firewall.netlocal.name`
- `gateway.netlocal.name`
- `http.netlocal.name`
  - I advise against setting up https on this subdomain. This will keep it clear for 
intentionally triggering http redirects to Wi-Fi sign on pages and such.

If you want to get in contact with me or put money behind the continued availability of this public resource
you can post a comment or open an issue [here](https://github.com/jessstrap/netlocal.name.source).
